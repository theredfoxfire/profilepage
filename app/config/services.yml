services:
    # First we define some basic services to make these utilities available in
    # the entire application

    # These are the Twig extensions that create new filters and functions for
    # using them in the templates
    # Uncomment the following lines to define a service for the Post Doctrine repository.
    # It's not mandatory to create these services, but if you use repositories a lot,
    # these services simplify your code:
    #
    # post_repository:
    #     class:     Doctrine\ORM\EntityRepository
    #     factory:   ["@doctrine.orm.entity_manager", getRepository]
    #     arguments: [IndexBundle\Entity\Post]
    #
    # // traditional code inside a controller
    # $em = $this->getDoctrine()->getManager();
    # $posts = $em->getRepository('IndexBundle:Post')->findAll();
    #
    # // same code using repository services
    # $posts = $this->get('post_repository')->findAll();
